            High school, as an institution, portrays itself as an integral feature of preparing students for a more intense and rigorous education. 
            However, much of the research I've conducted claims that the former value of high school as an educational institution has been lost, and in turn, students are unprepared for college and post-secondary education. 
            We see this display of inadequate preparation in students both academically and emotionally as they transition to college. 
            For example, in 2012, the number of high school graduates who met the SAT baseline of college readiness was only 43 percent (Venezia and Jaeger). 
            Whereas, in 2025, only 39% of SAT takers met or exceeded the college readiness standard. These statistics show how there has been an academic decline in college readiness since 2012, and no action has been taken to solve this problem. 
            Furthermore, it underscores the failure high schools are facing as students are gradually showing less growth and readiness as time goes on. 
            However, this isn’t the only way high schools as an institution have been failing to prepare their students.

          Emotionally, high school students seem to be more prone to stress as well as less connected to their emotions and mental health. 
            This is because of the stress most high school students endure due to how they view their academics and high school career as the single determining factor for getting into a “good” college. 
            As Tlili (2023) states, “The message from everyone — high school, parents, nonprofit organizations, the government, and the media — has been that everyone needs to go to college to be a success. 
            Even the kids who are not academically prepared are expected to attend college. So, for various reasons, high school has, over time, transformed from an institution that was made to offer the final level of formal schooling for most students into merely a stepping stone to “higher” education.” 
            This quote shows how high school’s inherent value of being a foundational educational institution is being lost because of how much society perpetuates the need to go to college as invaluable and as a societal standard for success. 
            This, in turn, molds students to believe that without attending college or a “good” one, they will be unable to find success in other areas of life.

          <p class="Ss2">
            Ultimately, the illusion doesn’t entirely begin with high school, but instead it’s where the need for college is put towards the forefront. 
            By constantly putting an emphasis on how students will end up, whether or not they decide to go to college, we deny students an exceptional high school experience. 
            Furthermore, for individuals who aren’t able to get into a good college, they will begin to internalize feelings of inadequacy and form a hatred for all forms of education.
