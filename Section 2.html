         <p class="S2">The first emotions experienced by students when they begin the transition to college are those of excitement, freedom, and confusion. 
          They are being introduced to an entirely new environment with new customs, traditions, and rules. 
          However, though these emotions feel great when it comes to the rigid and inflexible lifestyle of high school, college can feel overwhelming. 
          This is because of the lack of a social support system and the belief that colleges expect students to enter with a basic understanding of their systems.

          <p class="Ss2">
When we look at these aspects to examine how they begin to affect the experience of a student, we can narrow them to the students' need for a social support system, social capital, and cultural capital. The needs of students aren’t entirely academic; they also require vast amounts of social and emotional support to succeed in college. 
          In the article, Understanding College Preparedness of First-Semester College Students it talks about how high school students feel disheartened when it comes to higher education,  
          “According to a recent survey conducted by the national nonprofit Youth Truth (2016), only 45 percent of 165,000 junior and senior high school students between 2010-11 and 
          2014-15 reported feeling positive about their college and career readiness. The outcome of the survey is thought-provoking, especially when also considering 87 percent of the same students indicated a desire to pursue higher education (Youth Truth, 2016).” 
          As you can see from this quote, even though more students wanted and dreamed of college, many of them didn’t feel that they were ready. 
          </p>
    

          <p class="Ss2">​
This is where social support, social capital, and cultural capital come into play. Social support is the support that individuals receive from their network of family, friends, and community. Social capital provides individuals with the resources they need to gain information when forming casual or intimate relationships. Cultural capital is the support and encouragement provided by family and community that a student can draw inspiration from when attending or deciding to attend college (Florence). We see the benefits of these aspects in a college experience when Florence states,
“When I transitioned into UNLV from a Nevada public high school, I was a remedial learner. Initially I felt one semester behind my peers. However, I later learned that how you start college does not predict your academic future. For instance, in my first-semester as an undergraduate I was very committed to my coursework. I relied heavily on my college instructors/ professors for guidance. 
          My parents also helped by being emotionally and financially supportive of my ambition to achieve a college degree. Though my older brother and sister did not complete college past the first year, I was determined to persevere beyond the adversities and be academically successful in the first-year of college. (Florence)”
          </p>

This anecdote shows how, regardless of Florence’s academic standing during high school, she was able to stay committed and motivated to succeed in college because of the support given to her by her family, professors, and community. This quote shows how interdependent social support systems are to the success achieved by students in college.
