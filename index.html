     <div class="About">
    <p>The term student is a never-ending self-fulfilling concept built on the acquisition of knowledge and education. 
      This is something that rings true for me, as my love for knowledge and education often precedes my motivation when it comes to school. 
      However, as the value of education grows, the worse institutions do to provide students with a desire to learn and prepare them for the academic endeavors they will face. 
      When we look at education (specifically high school), we often put so much dependence on what it can do to create an easier and more accessible life for us in the future, that we begin to divert our focus from the benefits inherent to it and its cause. 
      Society has put college education on such a revered pedestal as a necessary marker of success that it seems almost second nature to pursue it without a plan or idea in mind. 
      This is because of how school and society advertise the concept of college and post-secondary education as the ideal and correct path, reinforcing the mindset that without it, individuals will have no way to guarantee their future and success.
